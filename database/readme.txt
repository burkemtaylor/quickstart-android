Neeraj Sabapathy and Burke Taylor, we configured the Google Quickstart 
which was provided already by Google and we then used Git to 
push the new config files and I added the readme.txt to explain what we did.

We added Firebase and added rules for authentication, 
also we downloaded new Gradle and Android Studio to configure 
this application to API 28 rather than a older version of the API
